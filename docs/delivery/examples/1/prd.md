# PBI 1: Example Feature - Add User Profile Page

**Status**: Proposed
**Created**: {{DATE}}
**Priority**: High | Medium | Low
**Effort**: Small | Medium | Large
**Category**: Feature | Bug Fix | Technical Debt | Research

## Problem Statement

Clearly describe the problem or opportunity this PBI addresses.

### Current State

- What exists today?
- What's working?
- What's not working?

### Business Impact

**User Impact**:
- How does this affect users?
- What pain points does it solve?

**Business Impact**:
- Revenue impact
- Cost savings
- Strategic value

## Proposed Solution

Describe the solution at a high level.

### Key Features

1. **Feature 1**: Brief description
2. **Feature 2**: Brief description
3. **Feature 3**: Brief description

### User Experience

Describe the user flow or experience:
1. User does X
2. System responds with Y
3. User sees Z

### Technical Approach

High-level technical overview:
- Architecture decisions
- Technology choices
- Integration points

## Success Criteria

Define clear, measurable success criteria:

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1 (specific and testable)
- [ ] Requirement 2 (specific and testable)
- [ ] Requirement 3 (specific and testable)

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Performance: Page loads in < 2 seconds
- [ ] Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- [ ] Security: Data encrypted at rest and in transit

### User Acceptance

- [ ] 90% of test users successfully complete key task
- [ ] No critical bugs reported in testing
- [ ] Positive feedback from stakeholders

## Testing Plan

### Unit Tests

- [ ] Test component X behavior
- [ ] Test service Y edge cases

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Test API integration
- [ ] Test database queries

### E2E/Manual Tests

- [ ] User can complete main workflow
- [ ] Error handling works correctly
- [ ] Edge cases handled gracefully

## Dependencies

- **Blocker**: PBI X must be complete first
- **Related**: Works with PBI Y
- **External**: Requires API access from vendor Z

## Risks & Mitigation

**Risk**: What could go wrong?
- *Mitigation*: How to prevent or address it

**Risk**: Another potential issue
- *Mitigation*: How to handle it

## Out of Scope

Explicitly list what this PBI does NOT include:
- Feature X (consider for future PBI)
- Integration with Y (separate effort)
- Performance optimization Z (technical debt PBI)

## Effort Estimate

**Total**: X days/hours

- Task 1: Y hours
- Task 2: Z hours
- Testing: W hours
- Buffer (20%): V hours

## Notes

### Design Decisions

- **Decision**: Why we chose approach A over B
- **Trade-off**: What we're optimizing for vs. against

### Open Questions

- [ ] Question 1 that needs answering?
- [ ] Question 2 for stakeholder input?

### Future Enhancements

Ideas for later:
- Enhancement 1
- Enhancement 2
